This file contains the scripts used to build the master station list.  The master station list found in resources subfolder contains a list of the weather stations I will use for my project.  These stations met the following criteria
1) They produce a daily climate report from the NWS (NOAA national weather service)
2) They are a metar reporting station
3) They have daily forecasts

Examples where climate reports are pulled
These are two example links for pulling climate reports. These links are basis for python code.
